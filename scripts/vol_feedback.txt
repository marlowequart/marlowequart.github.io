Looking at the volatility script, volatility_calculator_191204.py

Line 54 you are setting the range from i to i+30. Should that be TIME_WINDOW instead of 30?

After making this change I get a volatility40.csv(original file) and volatility40_2.csv(with change).
I created this script to plot all of the data, and it seems like there might be a time lag on the files from the
volatility script. Do you think we need to implement some sort of shift on the data?
