Looking at outfile date 2018-11-09, gives price of 7.94
S= 2794.1
K= 2032.32
t= 370
r=  0.0294
v= .171
When I calculate using the function put_opt_price, I get 1.262
Using t=365 I get 3.85

one problem might be that the way we are counting days is including weekends. So time delta for 1yr is 365, but t should be 252 trading days
